      "title": "Our “Hello World”",
      "text": "Ledg.it is Verinosc’s initial flagship initiative — an open‑source infrastructure developed to address the growing threat of synthetic media, disinformation, and digital content manipulation.\n<br/>At its core, ledg.it integrates imperceptible watermarking with decentralized verification, enabling digital media to carry verifiable provenance across formats, platforms, and time. This allows both institutions and individuals to validate the authenticity of media at the point of use — without relying on centralized intermediaries or reactive content moderation.\n<br/>Ledg.it is being developed in‑house by Verinosc and is intended for release under an open license, subject to available funding and aligned public interest support. Designed as a global public utility, the system aims to strengthen resilience in contexts such as democratic processes, journalism, cultural heritage, and digital archiving.\n<br/>This foundation will serve as the basis for future work — including metadata governance, trust infrastructure, and decentralized models for digital integrity."

As the scope of Verinosc’s work expands, additional governance structures — including advisory bodies and external participation mechanisms — will be established to support broader oversight and stakeholder inclusion.\n<br/>We are committed to transparency across all aspects of our work. Governance documents, development roadmaps, and funding reports will be published on an ongoing basis.\nOur Information Policy, outlining how we handle data, communication, and digital responsibility, is available here.\n<br/>This structure ensures that Verinosc remains accountable, open, and fully aligned with its public‑purpose mission."
